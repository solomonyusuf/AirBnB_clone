## Description :house:

this is a complete web application, integrating database storage, 
a back-end API, and front-end interfacing in a clone of AirBnB.

The project currently only implements the back-end console.

## Classes :cl:

HolbertonBnB utilizes the following classes:

|     | BaseModel | FileStorage | User | State | City | Amenity | Place | Review |
| --- | --------- | ----------- | -----| ----- | -----| ------- | ----- | ------ |

## Console :computer:

The console is a command line interpreter that permits management of the backend. It can be used to handle and manipulate all classes utilized by 
the application (achieved by calls on the `storage` object defined above).

### Using the Console

The console can be run both interactively and non-interactively. 
To run the console in non-interactive mode, pipe any command(s) into an execution 
of the file `console.py` at the command line.

```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb) 
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  count  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update

(hbnb) 
$
```

Alternatively, to use the HolbertonBnB console in interactive mode, run the 
file `console.py` by itself:

```
$ ./console.py
```
